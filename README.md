# Capstone

My crowning achievement at DevCodeCamp, solo capstone called Budget Pages using ASP.NET core. It was a web app that calculated estimated loans, taxes, as well as your budget. Taxes and budget have visulization that made it much more handy for a visual of where all your money go starting from your gross income down to the last dollar. 2 week sprint.
